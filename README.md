# Melanoma Detection using CNN
> Trying to understand how CNN helps detect a type of cancer

## Conclusions
- Tried to understand the data. create, compile and train a model. It overfits the training data. So used Data Augumentation and class rebalance techniques to treat the overfitted data and tried to bring down the loss and made the model not overfit the training data.

## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- scikit learn
- python
